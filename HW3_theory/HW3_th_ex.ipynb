    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a fundamental tool among the unsupervised learning model. Consider a problem with a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\left\\{x_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^n$ where $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ with no labels, we are aiming at finding some hidden structure within the data, namely, we would like to find clusters in the dataset. Classifiers have been studied in TP but mainly for supervised learning, here the data are not labeled. \n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm tries to classify the dataset in $K$ clusters. Each cluster is represented by a centroid, meaning the average of the points within the cluster. We note $C_k$ the set of points of a cluster $k$ and $\\mu_k$ its centroid. Then, the algorithm minimizes the intra-cluster variance, in other words, it tries to reduce the distance between the points of the cluster and the centroid. \n",
    "\n",
    "More technically, the algorithm works iteratively in two main steps: \n",
    " - Points are assigned to clusters based on their proximity to existing centroid\n",
    " - Centroids are updated by taking the average of the points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Loss function of the problem can be written as:\n",
    "$$J(\\mu_1, ..., \\mu_K) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\, \\lVert x_i - \\mu(i)\\rVert^2 \\; ,$$\n",
    "where $\\mu(i)$ is the centroid of the cluster assignated to $x_i$. \n",

    "However, one problem arised with initial Boltzmann Machine (BM) -- like its parent models in statistical physics (as the SK model) -- all the units are interacting through complicated dependencies. For example, if we consider 3 components of $\\mathbf{v}$: $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$, there are trivial interactions such as one modelised by $P(v_1, v_2)$ corresponding to the correlation between the two first components of $\\mathbf{v}$, but there are also none trivial interactions. Indeed, if some term like $P(v_1, v_2 | v_3)$ which suggests that the correlation $x_1$ and $v_2$ depends on $v_3$ and this is clearly none linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "A really ingenious way to overcome this situation is to replace all the tricky interactions between the units $\\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ by connections through hidden units $\\mathbf{h}\\in\\mathbb{R}^m$, artifically created. Indeed, correlations between two units $v_1$ and $v_2$ (specially the dependency of their correlations on other units $v_3$, $v_4$,...) can be atrificially replaced by introducing a third unit $h_1$ and considerin only linear correlations between $v_1 \\leftrightarrow h_1$, $h_1 \\leftrightarrow v_2$ and $v_1 \\leftrightarrow v_2$. The units $v_i$ are now called the visible units. This model is the most known version of BMs. \n",

    "Thus, the RBM architecture consists of two layers of binary stochastic units: a $\\textbf{visible layer}$ $\\mathbf{v}$ and a $\\textbf{hidden layer}$ $\\mathbf{h}$.

    "Is CD–k enough?\n",
    "- CD–k is a biased gradient estimator for finite k; the bias shrinks as k → ∞ (approaching exact maximum likelihood).\n",
    "- In practice, small k (e.g., CD-1 or CD-10) often suffices to learn good filters/features, especially early in training.\n",
    "- For better long-run accuracy/mixing, alternatives like Persistent CD (PCD) keep a running Markov chain (not reinitializing from data each step) to better approximate the model distribution.\n",
    "- For more faithful likelihood training, methods like stochastic maximum likelihood (SML/PCD), tempered transitions, or AIS can be used, but with more compute cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaway:\n",
    "CD–k trades off some bias for big computational savings. It’s widely used because it is fast, simple, and yields good results in many practical settings, even though it does not produce an exact maximum-likelihood gradient.\n"
